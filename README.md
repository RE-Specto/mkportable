# mkportable
package your app files to portable executabe in one click

just create a directory with all your app's files in it   
open mkp (for apps that needs run as admin) or mkpn (apps with no admin rights)   
and drag and drop the executable from that directory into the mkp window  
or alternatively, run mkp_install.cmd to add mkp and mkpn to Send To menu :)   

output file will be placed in the app directory, named dir_name-sfx.exe   

please note: packing apps that need admin rights using mkpn(no admin) will cause errors
